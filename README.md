# Mixed Messages

## Project Overview

Mixed Messages is a simple message generator program built using JavaScript. Each time the program is run, it outputs a new, randomized message. This project is part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Developer Career Path and is designed to reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts, version control using Git, and working with the command line.

## Features

- Generates a random message each time it is run

- Combines at least three different pieces of data to create a unique message

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

- Git & GitHub

- Command Line

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KeaganStrydom/mixed-messages.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd mixed-messages
    ```

## Usage
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the program using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node mixed-messages.js
    ```
3. Each time the script is run, a unique random message will be displayed in the terminal.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the message content within `script.js` to personalize the output. You can add new message components, themes (e.g., astrology, jokes, inspirational quotes), or expand the randomness.
